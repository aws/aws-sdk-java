 * DAX is a managed caching service engineered for Amazon DynamoDB. DAX dramatically speeds up database reads by caching
 * frequently-accessed data from DynamoDB, so applications can access that data with sub-millisecond latency. You can
 * create a DAX cluster easily, using the AWS Management Console. With a few simple modifications to your code, your
 * application can begin taking advantage of the DAX cluster and realize significant improvements in read performance.
