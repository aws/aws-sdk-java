/**
 * <p>
 * This is the <i>ACM Private CA API Reference</i>. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the
 * actions and data types involved in creating and managing private certificate authorities (CA) for your organization.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response. Alternatively, you can
 * use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using.
 * For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">AWS SDKs</a>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * Each ACM Private CA API action has a throttling limit which determines the number of times the action can be called
 * per second. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaLimits.html#PcaLimits-api">API Rate Limits in ACM
 * Private CA</a> in the ACM Private CA user guide.
