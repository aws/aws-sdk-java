 * <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image registry service. Customers can use the
 * familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure,
 * scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports
 * private repositories with resource-based permissions using IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can
 * access repositories and images.
