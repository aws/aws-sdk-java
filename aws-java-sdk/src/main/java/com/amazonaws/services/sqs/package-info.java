 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonSQS.

 * Amazon Simple Queue Service <p>
 * Welcome to the <i>Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference</i> . This
 * section describes who should read this guide, how the guide is
 * organized, and other resources related to the Amazon Simple Queue
 * Service (Amazon SQS).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon SQS offers reliable and scalable hosted queues for storing
 * messages as they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, you
 * can move data between distributed components of your applications that
 * perform different tasks without losing messages or requiring each
 * component to be always available.

 * We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SQS from your
 * preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that
 * automatically takes care of tasks such as:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Cryptographically signing your service requests</li>
 * <li>Retrying requests</li>
 * <li>Handling error responses</li>
 * 
 * </ul>
