 * <p>
 * Savings Plans are a pricing model that offer significant savings on AWS usage (for example, on Amazon EC2 instances).
 * You commit to a consistent amount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years, and receive a lower price
 * for that usage. For more information, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/">AWS Savings Plans User Guide</a>.
