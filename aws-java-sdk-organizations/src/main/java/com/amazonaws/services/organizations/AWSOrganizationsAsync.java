/**
 * Interface for accessing Organizations asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object
 * representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.organizations.AbstractAWSOrganizationsAsync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Organizations API Reference</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple AWS accounts into an
 * <i>organization</i> and centrally manage your accounts and their resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations API. For more information about using this service, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html">AWS Organizations User
 * Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>API Version</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This version of the Organizations API Reference documents the Organizations API version 2016-11-28.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample
 * code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, and more). The SDKs provide a
 * convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Organizations. For example, the SDKs take care of
 * cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about
 * the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon
 * Web Services</a>.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Organizations. However, you also can use the
 * Organizations Query API to make direct calls to the Organizations web service. To learn more about the Organizations
 * Query API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_query-requests.html">Making
 * Query Requests</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>. Organizations supports GET and POST requests for all
 * actions. That is, the API does not require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests
 * are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Signing Requests</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you send HTTP requests to AWS, you must sign the requests so that AWS can identify who sent them. You sign
 * requests with your AWS access key, which consists of an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend
 * that you do not create an access key for your root account. Anyone who has the access key for your root account has
 * unrestricted access to all the resources in your account. Instead, create an access key for an IAM user account that
 * has administrative privileges. As another option, use AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security
 * credentials, and use those credentials to sign requests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To sign requests, we recommend that you use <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>. If you have an
 * existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However,
 * some operations now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations that require version 4 indicate
 * this requirement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs to make requests to AWS, these tools
 * automatically sign the requests for you with the access key that you specify when you configure the tools.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In this release, each organization can have only one root. In a future release, a single organization will support
 * multiple roots.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Support and Feedback for AWS Organizations</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to <a
 * href="mailto:feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com">feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com</a> or post your feedback and
 * questions in the <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=219">AWS Organizations support forum</a>.
 * For more information about the AWS support forums, see <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa">Forums
 * Help</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Endpoint to Call When Using the CLI or the AWS API</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For the current release of Organizations, you must specify the <code>us-east-1</code> region for all AWS API and CLI
 * calls. You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its region:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code>
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>aws configure set default.region us-east-1</code>
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>--region us-east-1</code>
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For the various SDKs used to call the APIs, see the documentation for the SDK of interest to learn how to direct the
 * requests to a specific endpoint. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region">Regions and Endpoints</a> in the <i>AWS
 * General Reference</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>How examples are presented</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The JSON returned by the AWS Organizations service as response to your requests is returned as a single long string
 * without line breaks or formatting whitespace. Both line breaks and whitespace are included in the examples in this
 * guide to improve readability. When example input parameters also would result in long strings that would extend
 * beyond the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON
 * text string.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Recording API Requests</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Organizations supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log
 * files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which requests were
 * successfully made to Organizations, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS
 * Organizations and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_monitoring.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration"
 * >Logging AWS Organizations Events with AWS CloudTrail</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>. To learn more
 * about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">AWS CloudTrail
 * User Guide</a>.
