/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service with support for existing desktop and
 * mobile email clients. You can access your email, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or
 * other native iOS and Android email applications. You can integrate WorkMail with your existing corporate directory
 * and control both the keys that encrypt your data and the location in which your data is stored.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The WorkMail API is designed for the following scenarios:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Listing and describing organizations
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Managing users
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Managing groups
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Managing resources
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All WorkMail API operations are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the AWS
 * SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of AWS Identity and Access Management users and roles to help facilitate
 * access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the WorkMail site, the
 * IAM user gains full administrative visibility into the entire WorkMail organization (or as set in the IAM policy).
 * This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to create, update, and delete users, groups, and resources. This
 * allows developers to perform the scenarios listed above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a
 * selective basis using the IAM model.
 * </p>
