/**
 * <fullname>AWS Security Token Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege
 * credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users).
 * This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more detailed information about using this service, go to <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html">Temporary Security Credentials</a>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for
 * various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way
 * to create programmatic access to STS. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing
 * errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and
 * install them, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services page</a>.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, go to <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html">Signing AWS API Requests</a> in the
 * <i>AWS General Reference</i>. For general information about the Query API, go to <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html">Making Query Requests</a> in <i>Using
 * IAM</i>. For information about using security tokens with other AWS products, go to <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">AWS Services
 * That Work with IAM</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.

 * If you're new to AWS and need additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can find the
 * product's technical documentation at <a

 * <p>
 * <b>Endpoints</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Security Token Service (STS) has a default endpoint of https://sts.amazonaws.com that maps to the US East (N.
 * Virginia) region. Additional regions are available and are activated by default. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html">Activating and
 * Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For information about STS endpoints, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region">Regions and Endpoints</a> in the <i>AWS
 * General Reference</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Recording API requests</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to
 * an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were successfully
 * made to STS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn
 * it on and find your log files, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">AWS CloudTrail
 * User Guide</a>.
