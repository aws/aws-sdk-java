/**
 * <fullname>AWS Import/Export Service</fullname> AWS Import/Export accelerates transferring large amounts of data
 * between the AWS cloud and portable storage devices that you mail to us. AWS Import/Export transfers data directly
 * onto and off of your storage devices using Amazon's high-speed internal network and bypassing the Internet. For large
 * data sets, AWS Import/Export is often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective than upgrading your
 * connectivity.
