/**
 * <p>
 * AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization metrics of your AWS resources,
 * such as EC2 instances and Auto Scaling groups. It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates
 * optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also
 * provides recent utilization metric data, as well as projected utilization metric data for the recommendations, which
 * you can use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best price-performance trade-off. The analysis of your
 * usage patterns can help you decide when to move or resize your running resources, and still meet your performance and
 * capacity requirements. For more information about Compute Optimizer, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/">AWS Compute Optimizer User Guide</a>.
