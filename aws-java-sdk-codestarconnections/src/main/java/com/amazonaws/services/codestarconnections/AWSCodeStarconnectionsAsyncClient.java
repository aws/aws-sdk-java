/**
 * Client for accessing AWS CodeStar connections asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future
 * object representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * This AWS CodeStar Connections API Reference provides descriptions and usage examples of the operations and data types
 * for the AWS CodeStar Connections API. You can use the Connections API to work with connections and installations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <i>Connections</i> are configurations that you use to connect AWS resources to external code repositories. Each
 * connection is a resource that can be given to services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party repository
 * such as Bitbucket. For example, you can add the connection in CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a
 * code change is made to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and associated with a unique ARN
 * that is used to reference the connection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party connection handshake. <i>Installations</i> are the
 * apps that are used to conduct this handshake. For example, the installation for the Bitbucket provider type is the
 * Bitbucket Cloud app. When you create a connection, you can choose an existing installation or create one.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can work with connections by calling:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>CreateConnection</a>, which creates a uniquely named connection that can be referenced by services such as
 * CodePipeline.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>DeleteConnection</a>, which deletes the specified connection.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetConnection</a>, which returns information about the connection, including the connection status.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>ListConnections</a>, which lists the connections associated with your account.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For information about how to use AWS CodeStar Connections, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS CodePipeline User Guide</a>.
