/**
 * <fullname>Amazon Simple Workflow Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon's cloud to
 * coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a <i>task</i> represents a logical unit of work that is
 * performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies,
 * scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying
 * complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the Amazon SWF programming model, see the <i>
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/">Amazon SWF Developer Guide</a> </i>.
