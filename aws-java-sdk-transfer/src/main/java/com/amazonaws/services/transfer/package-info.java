 * Amazon Web Services Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the File
 * Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
 * directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate
 * your file transfer workflows to Amazon Web Services Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication
 * systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their
 * applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with Amazon Web Services services for processing,
 * analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with Amazon Web Services Transfer Family is easy since
 * there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.
