/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Image Builder provides a one-stop-shop to automate the image management processes. You
 * configure an automated pipeline that creates images for use on AWS. As software updates become available, Image
 * Builder automatically produces a new image based on a customizable schedule and distributes it to stipulated AWS
 * Regions after running tests on it. With the Image Builder, organizations can capture their internal or
 * industry-specific compliance policies as a vetted template that can be consistently applied to every new image.
 * Built-in integration with AWS Organizations provides customers with a centralized way to enforce image distribution
 * and access policies across their AWS accounts and Regions. Image Builder supports multiple image format AMIs on AWS.
