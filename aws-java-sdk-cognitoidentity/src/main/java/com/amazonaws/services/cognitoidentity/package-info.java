/**
 * <fullname>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary credentials to mobile devices and
 * other untrusted environments. It uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over
 * the lifetime of an application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or more third-party identity
 * providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support
 * unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token
 * provider trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flow.html">Authentication Flow</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information see <a

 * Identities</a>.
