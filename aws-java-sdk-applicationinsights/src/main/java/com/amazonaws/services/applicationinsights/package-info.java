/**
 * <fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server is a service that helps you detect common problems
 * with your .NET and SQL Server-based applications. It enables you to pinpoint the source of issues in your
 * applications (built with technologies such as Microsoft IIS, .NET, and Microsoft SQL Server), by providing key
 * insights into detected problems.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After you onboard your application, CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server identifies, recommends,
 * and sets up metrics and logs. It continuously analyzes and correlates your metrics and logs for unusual behavior to
 * surface actionable problems with your application. For example, if your application is slow and unresponsive and
 * leading to HTTP 500 errors in your Application Load Balancer (ALB), Application Insights informs you that a memory
 * pressure problem with your SQL Server database is occurring. It bases this analysis on impactful metrics and log
 * errors.
 * </p>
