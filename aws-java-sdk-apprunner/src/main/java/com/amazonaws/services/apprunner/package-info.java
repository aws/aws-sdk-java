/**
 * <fullname>AWS App Runner</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an
 * existing container image or source code to a running service in the AWS cloud in seconds. You don't need to learn new
 * technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how to provision and configure AWS resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery
 * pipeline with fully managed operations, high performance, scalability, and security.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about App Runner, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/">AWS App
 * Runner Developer Guide</a>. For release information, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/">AWS App Runner Release Notes</a>.

 * tools that you can use to access the API, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
 * Services</a>.
