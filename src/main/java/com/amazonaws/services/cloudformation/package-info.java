/**
 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonCloudFormation.
 *
 * AWS CloudFormation <p>
 * AWS CloudFormation enables you to create and manage AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. AWS CloudFormation helps you leverage
 * AWS products such as Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost effective applications without
 * worrying about creating and configuring the underlying the AWS infrastructure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a
 * single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the
 * resources for you.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about this product, go to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/"> CloudFormation Product Page </a> .

 * Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can find the
 * product's technical documentation at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/"> http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ </a> .

 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b>You must call the AWS CloudFormation API as a regular IAM user. AWS CloudFormation does not support calling the API with an IAM role
