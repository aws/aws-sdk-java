/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonRedshift asynchronously.
 * Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object, and users are also allowed
 * to provide a callback handler.
 * Amazon Redshift <b>Overview</b> <p>
 * This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation for one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to
 * manage Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling
 * or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a
 * change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster
 * management interfaces, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html"> Using the Amazon Redshift Management
 * Interfaces </a> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the
 * cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your business
 * and customers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the The <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html"> Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide </a>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you are a database developer, the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html"> Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide
 * </a> explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that make up your data warehouse.
