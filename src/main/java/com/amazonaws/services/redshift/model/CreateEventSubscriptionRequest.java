/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.redshift.AmazonRedshift#createEventSubscription(CreateEventSubscriptionRequest) CreateEventSubscription operation}.
 * <p>
 * Creates an Amazon Redshift event notification subscription. This action requires an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of an Amazon SNS topic created by
 * either the Amazon Redshift console, the Amazon SNS console, or the Amazon SNS API. To obtain an ARN with Amazon SNS, you must create a topic in Amazon
 * SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the SNS console.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can specify the source type, and lists of Amazon Redshift source IDs, event categories, and event severities. Notifications will be sent for all
 * events you want that match those criteria. For example, you can specify source type = cluster, source ID = my-cluster-1 and mycluster2, event
 * categories = Availability, Backup, and severity = ERROR. The subsription will only send notifications for those ERROR events in the Availability and
 * Backup categores for the specified clusters.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you specify both the source type and source IDs, such as source type = cluster and source identifier = my-cluster-1, notifiactions will be sent
 * for all the cluster events for my-cluster-1. If you specify a source type but do not specify a source identifier, you will receive notice of the
 * events for the objects of that type in your AWS account. If you do not specify either the SourceType nor the SourceIdentifier, you will be notified of
 * events generated from all Amazon Redshift sources belonging to your AWS account. You must specify a source type if you specify a source ID.
