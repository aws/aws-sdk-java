 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonCognitoSync.
 *
 * Amazon Cognito Sync <p>
 * Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that
 * enable cross-device syncing of application-related user data.
 * High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and Android.
 * You can use these libraries to persist data locally so that it's
 * available even if the device is offline. Developer credentials don't
 * need to be stored on the mobile device to access the service. You can
 * use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and credentials.
 * User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of
 * key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.
 * </p>
