/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.storagegateway.AWSStorageGateway#deleteGateway(DeleteGatewayRequest) DeleteGateway operation}.
 * <p>
 * This operation deletes a gateway. To specify which gateway to delete, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request. The operation
 * deletes the gateway; however, it does not delete the gateway virtual machine (VM) from your host computer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After you delete a gateway, you cannot reactivate it. Completed snapshots of the gateway volumes are not deleted upon deleting the gateway, however,
 * pending snapshots will not complete. After you delete a gateway, your next step is to remove it from your environment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> You no longer pay software charges after the gateway is deleted; however, your existing Amazon EBS snapshots persist and you will
 * continue to be billed for these snapshots.??You can choose to remove all remaining Amazon EBS snapshots by canceling your Amazon EC2 subscription.??
 * If you prefer not to cancel your Amazon EC2 subscription, you can delete your snapshots using the Amazon EC2 console. For more information, see the
 * AWS Storage Gateway Detail Page.
