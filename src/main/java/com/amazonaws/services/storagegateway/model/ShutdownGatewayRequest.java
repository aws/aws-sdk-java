/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.storagegateway.AWSStorageGateway#shutdownGateway(ShutdownGatewayRequest) ShutdownGateway operation}.
 * <p>
 * This operation shuts down a gateway. To specify which gateway to shut down, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of your
 * request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The operation shuts down the gateway service component running in the storage gateway's virtual machine (VM) and not the VM.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b>If you want to shut down the VM, it is recommended that you first shut down the gateway component in the VM to avoid unpredictable
 * conditions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call any other API except StartGateway, DescribeGatewayInformation, and ListGateways. For more information,
 * see ActivateGateway. Your applications cannot read from or write to the gateway's storage volumes, and there are no snapshots taken.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b>When you make a shutdown request, you will get a 200 OK success response immediately. However, it might take some time for the gateway to
 * shut down. You can call the DescribeGatewayInformation API to check the status. For more information, see ActivateGateway.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If do not intend to use the gateway again, you must delete the gateway (using DeleteGateway) to no longer pay software charges associated with the
 * gateway.
 * </p>
