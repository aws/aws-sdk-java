/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.glacier.AmazonGlacier#describeVault(DescribeVaultRequest) DescribeVault operation}.
 * <p>
 * This operation returns information about a vault, including the vault's Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the date the vault was created, the number of
 * archives it contains, and the total size of all the archives in the vault. The number of archives and their total size are as of the last inventory
 * generation. This means that if you add or remove an archive from a vault, and then immediately use Describe Vault, the change in contents will not be
 * immediately reflected. If you want to retrieve the latest inventory of the vault, use InitiateJob. Amazon Glacier generates vault inventories
 * approximately daily. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-inventory.html"> Downloading
 * a Vault Inventory in Amazon Glacier </a> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
 * permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html"> Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access
 * Management (IAM) </a> .
