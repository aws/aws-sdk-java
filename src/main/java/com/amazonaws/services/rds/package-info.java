 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonRDS.
 *
 * Amazon Relational Database Service <p>
 * Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that
 * makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in
 * the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an
 * industry-standard relational database and manages common database
 * administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes
 * their applications and businesses unique.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a familiar MySQL
 * or Oracle database server. This means the code, applications, and
 * tools you already use today with your existing MySQL or Oracle
 * databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS
 * automatically backs up your database and maintains the database
 * software that powers your DB Instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can
 * scale your database instance's compute resources and storage capacity
 * to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services,
 * there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources
 * you use.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is the <i>Amazon RDS API Reference</i> . It contains a
 * comprehensive description of all Amazon RDS Query APIs and data types.
 * To get started with Amazon RDS, go to the <a
 * p://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonRDS/latest/GettingStartedGuide/">
 * Amazon RDS Getting Started Guide </a> . For more information on Amazon
 * RDS concepts and usage scenarios, go to the <a
