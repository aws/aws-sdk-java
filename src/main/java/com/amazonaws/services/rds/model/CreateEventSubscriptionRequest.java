 * Creates an RDS event notification subscription. This action requires a topic ARN (Amazon Resource Name) created by either the RDS console, the SNS
 * console, or the SNS API. To obtain an ARN with SNS, you must create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the SNS
 * console.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can specify the type of source (SourceType) you want to be notified of, provide a list of RDS sources (SourceIds) that triggers the events, and
 * provide a list of event categories (EventCategories) for events you want to be notified of. For example, you can specify SourceType = db-instance,
 * SourceIds = mydbinstance1, mydbinstance2 and EventCategories = Availability, Backup.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you specify both the SourceType and SourceIds, such as SourceType = db-instance and SourceIdentifier = myDBInstance1, you will be notified of all
 * the db-instance events for the specified source. If you specify a SourceType but do not specify a SourceIdentifier, you will receive notice of the
 * events for that source type for all your RDS sources. If you do not specify either the SourceType nor the SourceIdentifier, you will be notified of
 * events generated from all RDS sources belonging to your customer account.
