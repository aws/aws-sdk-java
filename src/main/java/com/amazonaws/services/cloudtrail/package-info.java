/**
 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AWSCloudTrail.
 *
 * AWS Cloud Trail <p>
 * This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information
 * includes the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements
 * returned by the service.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
 * languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWSCloudTrail. For
 * example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS
 * SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services page.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * See the CloudTrail User Guide for information about the data that is included with each AWS API call listed in the log files.
 * </p>
