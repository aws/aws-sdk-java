/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonDynamoDBv2.
 * Amazon DynamoDB <b>Overview</b> <p>
 * This is the Amazon DynamoDB API Reference. This guide provides
 * descriptions and samples of the low-level DynamoDB API. For
 * information about DynamoDB application development, go to the
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/"> Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide </a>
 * .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instead of making the requests to the low-level DynamoDB API directly
 * from your application, we recommend that you use the AWS Software
 * Development Kits (SDKs). The easy-to-use libraries in the AWS SDKs
 * make it unnecessary to call the low-level DynamoDB API directly from
 * your application. The libraries take care of request authentication,
 * serialization, and connection management. For more information, go to
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/UsingAWSSDK.html"> Using the AWS SDKs with DynamoDB </a>
 * in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you decide to code against the low-level DynamoDB API directly, you
 * will need to write the necessary code to authenticate your requests.
 * For more information on signing your requests, go to
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/API.html"> Using the DynamoDB API </a>
 * in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following are short descriptions of each low-level API action,
 * organized by function.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Managing Tables</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>CreateTable</i> - Creates a table with user-specified provisioned
 * throughput settings. You must designate one attribute as the hash
 * primary key for the table; you can optionally designate a second
 * attribute as the range primary key. DynamoDB creates indexes on these
 * key attributes for fast data access. Optionally, you can create one or
 * more secondary indexes, which provide fast data access using non-key
 * attributes.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>DescribeTable</i> - Returns metadata for a table, such as table
 * size, status, and index information.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>UpdateTable</i> - Modifies the provisioned throughput settings for
 * a table. Optionally, you can modify the provisioned throughput
 * settings for global secondary indexes on the table.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>ListTables</i> - Returns a list of all tables associated with the
 * current AWS account and endpoint.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>DeleteTable</i> - Deletes a table and all of its indexes.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For conceptual information about managing tables, go to
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html"> Working with Tables </a>
 * in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Reading Data</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>GetItem</i> - Returns a set of attributes for the item that has a
 * given primary key. By default, <i>GetItem</i> performs an eventually
 * consistent read; however, applications can specify a strongly
 * consistent read instead.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>BatchGetItem</i> - Performs multiple <i>GetItem</i> requests for
 * data items using their primary keys, from one table or multiple
 * tables. The response from <i>BatchGetItem</i> has a size limit of 1 MB
 * and returns a maximum of 100 items. Both eventually consistent and
 * strongly consistent reads can be used.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>Query</i> - Returns one or more items from a table or a secondary
 * index. You must provide a specific hash key value. You can narrow the
 * scope of the query using comparison operators against a range key
 * value, or on the index key. <i>Query</i> supports either eventual or
 * strong consistency. A single response has a size limit of 1 MB.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>Scan</i> - Reads every item in a table; the result set is
 * eventually consistent. You can limit the number of items returned by
 * filtering the data attributes, using conditional expressions.
 * <i>Scan</i> can be used to enable ad-hoc querying of a table against
 * non-key attributes; however, since this is a full table scan without
 * using an index, <i>Scan</i> should not be used for any application
 * query use case that requires predictable performance.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For conceptual information about reading data, go to
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html"> Working with Items </a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/QueryAndScan.html"> Query and Scan Operations </a>
 * in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Modifying Data</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>PutItem</i> - Creates a new item, or replaces an existing item
 * with a new item (including all the attributes). By default, if an item
 * in the table already exists with the same primary key, the new item
 * completely replaces the existing item. You can use conditional
 * operators to replace an item only if its attribute values match
 * certain conditions, or to insert a new item only if that item doesn't
 * already exist.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>UpdateItem</i> - Modifies the attributes of an existing item. You
 * can also use conditional operators to perform an update only if the
 * item's attribute values match certain conditions.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>DeleteItem</i> - Deletes an item in a table by primary key. You
 * can use conditional operators to perform a delete an item only if the
 * item's attribute values match certain conditions.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> - Performs multiple <i>PutItem</i> and
 * <i>DeleteItem</i> requests across multiple tables in a single request.
 * A failure of any request(s) in the batch will not cause the entire
 * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> operation to fail. Supports batches of up to 25
 * items to put or delete, with a maximum total request size of 1 MB.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For conceptual information about modifying data, go to
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html"> Working with Items </a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/QueryAndScan.html"> Query and Scan Operations </a>
 * in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i> .

     * The individual <i>PutItem</i> and <i>DeleteItem</i> operations
     * specified in <i>BatchWriteItem</i> are atomic; however
     * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> as a whole is not. If any requested operations
     * fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an
     * internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned
     * in the <i>UnprocessedItems</i> response parameter. You can investigate
     * and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call
     * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> in a loop. Each iteration would check for
     * unprocessed items and submit a new <i>BatchWriteItem</i> request with
     * those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note that if <i>none</i> of the items can be processed due to
     * insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the
     * request, then <i>BatchGetItem</i> will throw a
     * <i>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</i> .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To write one item, you can use the <i>PutItem</i> operation; to
     * delete one item, you can use the <i>DeleteItem</i> operation.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * With <i>BatchWriteItem</i> , you can efficiently write or delete
     * large amounts of data, such as from Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR), or
     * copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve
     * performance with these large-scale operations, <i>BatchWriteItem</i>
     * does not behave in the same way as individual <i>PutItem</i> and
     * <i>DeleteItem</i> calls would For example, you cannot specify
     * conditions on individual put and delete requests, and
     * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> does not return deleted items in the response.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, such as
     * Java, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application
     * must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages
     * that don't support threading, such as PHP, you must update or delete
     * the specified items one at a time. In both situations,
     * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> provides an alternative where the API performs
     * the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the
     * power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce
     * complexity into your application.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and
     * delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units
     * whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on
     * nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit.
     * </p>
     * <p>

     * batch write operation:
     * </p>

     * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> in a loop. Each iteration would check for
     * unprocessed items and submit a new <i>BatchWriteItem</i> request with
     * those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note that if <i>none</i> of the items can be processed due to

     * <p>
     * With <i>BatchWriteItem</i> , you can efficiently write or delete
     * large amounts of data, such as from Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR), or
     * copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve
     * performance with these large-scale operations, <i>BatchWriteItem</i>
     * does not behave in the same way as individual <i>PutItem</i> and

     * conditions on individual put and delete requests, and
     * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> does not return deleted items in the response.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, such as
     * Java, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application
     * must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages
     * that don't support threading, such as PHP, you must update or delete
     * the specified items one at a time. In both situations,
     * <i>BatchWriteItem</i> provides an alternative where the API performs
     * the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the
     * power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce
     * complexity into your application.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and
     * delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units
     * whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on
     * nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit.
