 * AWS Import/Export Service <p>
 * AWS Import/Export accelerates transferring large amounts of data between the AWS cloud and portable storage devices that you mail to us. AWS
 * Import/Export transfers data directly onto and off of your storage devices using Amazon's high-speed internal network and bypassing the Internet. For
 * large data sets, AWS Import/Export is often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective than upgrading your connectivity.
