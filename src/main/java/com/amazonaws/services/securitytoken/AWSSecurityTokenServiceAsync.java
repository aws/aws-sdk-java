 * This is the <i>AWS Security Token Service API Reference</i> . The AWS Security Token Service is a web service that enables you to request temporary,
 * limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users). This guide
 * provides descriptions of the AWS Security Token Service API as well as links to related content in <a
 * href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/"> Using IAM </a> .
 * </p>

 * For more detailed information about using this service, go to <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/TokenBasedAuth.html">
 * Granting Temporary Access to Your AWS Resources </a> in <i>Using IAM</i> .
