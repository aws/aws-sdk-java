/**
 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonSQS.
 *
 * Amazon Simple Queue Service <p>
 * Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. By
 * using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between distributed components of their applications that perform different tasks, without losing
 * messages or requiring each component to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build an automated workflow, working in close conjunction
 * with the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web services.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon SQS works by exposing Amazon's web-scale messaging infrastructure as a web service. Any computer on the Internet can add or read messages
 * without any installed software or special firewall configurations. Components of applications using Amazon SQS can run independently, and do not need
 * to be on the same network, developed with the same technologies, or running at the same time.
 * </p>
