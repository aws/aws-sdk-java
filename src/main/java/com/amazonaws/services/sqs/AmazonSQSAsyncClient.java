/**
 * Asynchronous client for accessing AmazonSQS.
 * All asynchronous calls made using this client are non-blocking. Callers could either
 * process the result and handle the exceptions in the worker thread by providing a callback handler
 * when making the call, or use the returned Future object to check the result of the call in the calling thread.
 * Amazon Simple Queue Service <p>
 * Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. By
 * using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between distributed components of their applications that perform different tasks, without losing
 * messages or requiring each component to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build an automated workflow, working in close conjunction
 * with the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web services.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon SQS works by exposing Amazon's web-scale messaging infrastructure as a web service. Any computer on the Internet can add or read messages
 * without any installed software or special firewall configurations. Components of applications using Amazon SQS can run independently, and do not need
 * to be on the same network, developed with the same technologies, or running at the same time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Visit <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/"> http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/ </a> for more information.

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, let's say you have a message and its default message
     * visibility timeout is 30 minutes. You could call
     * <code>ChangeMessageVisiblity</code> with a value of two hours and the
     * effective timeout would be two hours and 30 minutes. When that time
     * comes near you could again extend the time out by calling
     * ChangeMessageVisiblity, but this time the maximum allowed timeout
     * would be 9 hours and 30 minutes.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>IMPORTANT:</b>If you attempt to set the VisibilityTimeout to an
     * amount more than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error.
     * It will not automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the
     * maximum time remaining.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>IMPORTANT:</b>Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility
     * timeout for a specific message, that timeout value is applied
     * immediately but is not saved in memory for that message. If you don't
     * delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the
     * message the next time it is received reverts to the original timeout
     * value, not the value you set with the ChangeMessageVisibility action.
