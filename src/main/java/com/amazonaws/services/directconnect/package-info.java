 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonDirectConnect.

 * AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using AWS Direct
 * Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce
 * your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.
 * </p>

 * The AWS Direct Connect API Reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for AWS Direct Connect.
