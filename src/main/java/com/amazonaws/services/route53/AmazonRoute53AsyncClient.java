     * Use this action to create or change your authoritative DNS
     * information. To use this action, send a <code>POST</code> request to
     * the <code>2012-12-12/hostedzone/hosted Zone ID/rrset</code> resource.
     * The request body must include an XML document with a
     * <code>ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest</code> element.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Changes are a list of change items and are considered transactional.
     * For more information on transactional changes, also known as change
     * batches, see <a
     * zon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/RRSchanges.html#RRSchanges_API">
     * Creating, Changing, and Deleting Resource Record Sets Using the Route
     * 53 API </a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i> .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>IMPORTANT:</b>Due to the nature of transactional changes, you
     * cannot delete the same resource record set more than once in a single
     * change batch. If you attempt to delete the same change batch more than
     * once, Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In response to a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> request, your
     * DNS data is changed on all Route 53 DNS servers. Initially, the status
     * of a change is <code>PENDING</code> . This means the change has not
     * yet propagated to all the authoritative Route 53 DNS servers. When the
     * change is propagated to all hosts, the change returns a status of
     * <code>INSYNC</code> .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note the following limitations on a
     * <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> request:
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * - A request cannot contain more than 100 Change elements.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * - A request cannot contain more than 1000 ResourceRecord elements.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The sum of the number of characters (including spaces) in all
     * <code>Value</code> elements in a request cannot exceed 32,000
     * characters.
