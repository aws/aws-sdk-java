 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonSimpleDB.
 *
 * Amazon SimpleDB <p>
 * Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions of data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and effort
 * associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB provides developers the freedom to focus on application development.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront capital outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive and
 * repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically simpler, requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and providing a
 * simple API for storage and access. This approach eliminates the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and performance tuning.
 * Developers gain access to this functionality within Amazon's proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and pay only for what they
 * use.
