/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonSimpleDB asynchronously.
 * Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object, and users are also allowed
 * to provide a callback handler.
 * Amazon SimpleDB <p>
 * Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions of data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and effort
 * associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB provides developers the freedom to focus on application development.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront capital outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive and
 * repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically simpler, requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and providing a
 * simple API for storage and access. This approach eliminates the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and performance tuning.
 * Developers gain access to this functionality within Amazon's proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and pay only for what they
 * use.
 * </p>

     * The PutAttributes operation creates or replaces attributes in an
     * item. The client may specify new attributes using a combination of the

     * and <code>Attribute.1.Value</code> , and so on.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Attributes are uniquely identified in an item by their name/value

     * <code>{ "first_name", "first_value" }</code> and <code>{ "first_name",

     * <code>{ 'b', '2'}</code> and <code>{ 'b', '3'
     * }</code> and the requestor calls <code>PutAttributes</code> using the

     * parameter set to true, the final attributes of the item are changed to
     * <code>{ 'a', '1' }</code> and <code>{ 'b', '4' }</code> , which
