/**
 * Represents the versioning configuration for a bucket.
 * <p>
 * A bucket's versioning configuration can be in one of three possible states:
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>{@link BucketVersioningConfiguration#OFF}
 *      <li>{@link BucketVersioningConfiguration#ENABLED}
 *      <li>{@link BucketVersioningConfiguration#SUSPENDED}
 *  </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default, new buckets are in the
 * {@link BucketVersioningConfiguration#OFF off} state. Once versioning is
 * enabled for a bucket the status can never be reverted to
 * {@link BucketVersioningConfiguration#OFF off}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition to enabling versioning, a bucket's versioning configuration can
 * also enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Delete, which restricts the
 * ability to permanently delete a version of an object. When MFA Delete is
 * enabled, only requests from the bucket owner which include an MFA token
 * generated by the hardware authentication device associated with the bucket
 * owner's AWS account can permanently delete an object version. For more
 * information on AWS Multi-Factor Authentication see <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/mfa/">http://aws.amazon.com/mfa/</a>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The versioning configuration of a bucket has different implications for each
 * operation performed on that bucket or for objects within that bucket. For
 * instance, when versioning is enabled, a PutObject operation creates a unique
 * object version-id for the object being uploaded. The PutObject API guarantees
 * that, if versioning is enabled for a bucket at the time of the request, the
 * new object can only be permanently deleted using the DeleteVersion operation.
 * It can never be overwritten. Additionally, PutObject guarantees that, if
 * versioning is enabled for a bucket the request, no other object will be
 * overwritten by that request. Refer to the documentation sections for each API
 * for information on how versioning status affects the semantics of that
 * particular API.
 * <p>
 * S3 is eventually consistent. It may take time for the versioning status of a
 * bucket to be propagated throughout the system.
 * 
 * @see AmazonS3#getBucketVersioningConfiguration(String)
 * @see AmazonS3#setBucketVersioningConfiguration(SetBucketVersioningConfigurationRequest)
