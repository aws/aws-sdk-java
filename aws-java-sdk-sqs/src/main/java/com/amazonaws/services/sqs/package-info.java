/**
 * <p>
 * Welcome to the <i>Amazon SQS API Reference</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon SQS is a reliable, highly-scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between applications or
 * microservices. Amazon SQS moves data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these
 * components.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-authentication-and-access-control.html"
 * >Identity and access management</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide.</i>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a> to access Amazon SQS using your
 * favorite programming language. The SDKs perform tasks such as the following automatically:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Cryptographically sign your service requests
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Retry requests
 * </p>
 * </li>
