/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane APIs manage encryption keys for use during payment-related
 * cryptographic operations. You can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can also manage
 * Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity and access
 * management</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.</i>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use encryption keys for payment-related transaction processing and associated cryptographic operations, you use
 * the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/DataAPIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon Web
 * Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane</a>. You can perform actions like encrypt, decrypt, generate, and verify
 * payment-related data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography API calls must be signed and transmitted using Transport Layer Security
 * (TLS). We recommend you always use the latest supported TLS version for logging API requests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports CloudTrail for control plane operations, a service that logs Amazon
 * Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3
 * bucket you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to
 * Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. If you don't conﬁgure a
 * trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console. For more information, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">CloudTrail User Guide</a>.
