/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon Pinpoint SMS Voice V2 asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java
 * Future object representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to
 * receive notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.pinpointsmsvoicev2.AbstractAmazonPinpointSMSVoiceV2Async} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Welcome to the <i>Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice, version 2 API Reference</i>. This guide provides information about
 * Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice, version 2 API resources, including supported HTTP methods, parameters, and schemas.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Pinpoint is an Amazon Web Services service that you can use to engage with your recipients across multiple
 * messaging channels. The Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice, version 2 API provides programmatic access to options that are
 * unique to the SMS and voice channels and supplements the resources provided by the Amazon Pinpoint API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, it's also helpful to review the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html"> Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide</a>.
 * The <i>Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide</i> provides tutorials, code samples, and procedures that demonstrate how to
 * use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically and how to integrate Amazon Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and
 * other types of applications. The guide also provides key information, such as Amazon Pinpoint integration with other
 * Amazon Web Services services, and the quotas that apply to use of the service.
