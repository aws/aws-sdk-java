If the number of tasks running in a service drops below <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS spawns another instantiation of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see <a>UpdateService</a>.</p> <p>In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service.</p> <p>You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. During a deployment (which is triggered by changing the task definition of a service with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation), the service scheduler uses the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and <code>maximumPercent</code> parameters to determine the deployment strategy.</p> <p>If the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore the <code>desiredCount</code> temporarily during a deployment. For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks, a <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state; tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance it is hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 50% in the console and 100% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs.</p> <p>The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks, a <code>maximumPercent</code> value of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for <code>maximumPercent</code> is 200%.</p> <p>When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it attempts to balance them across the Availability Zones in your cluster with the following logic:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).</p> </li> <li> <p>Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.</p> </li> </ul>",

This parameter specifies the minimum amount of CPU to reserve for a container, and containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. This parameter maps to <code>CpuShares</code> in the <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.19/#create-a-container\">Create a container</a> section of the <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.19/\">Docker Remote API</a> and the <code>--cpu-shares</code> option to <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/run/\">docker run</a>.</p> <note> <p>You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">Amazon EC2 Instances</a> detail page by 1,024.</p> </note> <p>For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that is the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units.</p> <p>The Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/reference/run/#cpu-share-constraint\">CPU share constraint</a> in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2; however, the CPU parameter is not required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0:</b> Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to 2 CPU shares.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0:</b> Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.</p> </li>\n@return Returns a reference to this object so that method calls can be chained together.*/"

However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units.</p> <p>The Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers.

By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses; however the container may use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/\">Configure logging drivers</a> in the Docker documentation.</p> <note> <p>Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the <a>LogConfiguration</a> data type). Currently unsupported log drivers may be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent.</p> </note> <p>This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: <code>sudo docker version | grep \"Server API version\"</code> </p> <note> <p>The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the <code>ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS</code> environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html\">Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>\n@return Returns a reference to this object so that method calls can be chained together.*/"
