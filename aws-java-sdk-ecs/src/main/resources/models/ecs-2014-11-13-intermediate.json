If the number of tasks running in a service drops below <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS spawns another instantiation of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see <a>UpdateService</a>.</p> <p>In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html\">Service Load Balancing</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. During a deployment (which is triggered by changing the task definition of a service with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation), the service scheduler uses the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and <code>maximumPercent</code> parameters to determine the deployment strategy.</p> <p>If the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore the <code>desiredCount</code> temporarily during a deployment. For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks, a <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state; tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance it is hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 50% in the console and 100% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs.</p> <p>The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks, a <code>maximumPercent</code> value of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for <code>maximumPercent</code> is 200%.</p> <p>When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it attempts to balance them across the Availability Zones in your cluster with the following logic:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).</p> </li> <li> <p>Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.</p> </li> </ul>",
