/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS CodeBuild asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object
 * representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.codebuild.AbstractAWSCodeBuildAsync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS CodeBuild</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit
 * tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and
 * scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming languages
 * and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in AWS
 * CodeBuild to use your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay only
 * for the build time you consume. For more information about AWS CodeBuild, see the <i>AWS CodeBuild User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS CodeBuild supports these operations:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>BatchDeleteBuilds</code>: Deletes one or more builds.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>BatchGetProjects</code>: Gets information about one or more build projects. A <i>build project</i> defines how
 * AWS CodeBuild runs a build. This includes information such as where to get the source code to build, the build
 * environment to use, the build commands to run, and where to store the build output. A <i>build environment</i> is a
 * representation of operating system, programming language runtime, and tools that AWS CodeBuild uses to run a build.
 * You can add tags to build projects to help manage your resources and costs.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>CreateProject</code>: Creates a build project.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>CreateWebhook</code>: For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub
 * or Bitbucket repository, enables AWS CodeBuild to start rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed
 * to the repository.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>UpdateWebhook</code>: Changes the settings of an existing webhook.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>DeleteProject</code>: Deletes a build project.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>DeleteWebhook</code>: For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub
 * or Bitbucket repository, stops AWS CodeBuild from rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to
 * the repository.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>ListProjects</code>: Gets a list of build project names, with each build project name representing a single
 * build project.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>UpdateProject</code>: Changes the settings of an existing build project.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>BatchGetBuilds</code>: Gets information about one or more builds.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>ListBuilds</code>: Gets a list of build IDs, with each build ID representing a single build.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>ListBuildsForProject</code>: Gets a list of build IDs for the specified build project, with each build ID
 * representing a single build.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>StartBuild</code>: Starts running a build.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>StopBuild</code>: Attempts to stop running a build.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>ListCuratedEnvironmentImages</code>: Gets information about Docker images that are managed by AWS CodeBuild.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>DeleteSourceCredentials</code>: Deletes a set of GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket source credentials.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>ImportSourceCredentials</code>: Imports the source repository credentials for an AWS CodeBuild project that has
 * its source code stored in a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket repository.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>ListSourceCredentials</code>: Returns a list of <code>SourceCredentialsInfo</code> objects. Each
 * <code>SourceCredentialsInfo</code> object includes the authentication type, token ARN, and type of source provider
 * for one set of credentials.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
