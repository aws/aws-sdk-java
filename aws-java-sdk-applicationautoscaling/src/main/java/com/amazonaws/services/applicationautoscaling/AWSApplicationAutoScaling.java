/**
 * Interface for accessing Application Auto Scaling.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.applicationautoscaling.AbstractAWSApplicationAutoScaling} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * With Application Auto Scaling, you can configure automatic scaling for your scalable resources. You can use
 * Application Auto Scaling to accomplish the following tasks:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Define scaling policies to automatically scale your AWS or custom resources
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Schedule one-time or recurring scaling actions
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * View the history of your scaling events
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Application Auto Scaling can scale the following resources:
 * </p>
