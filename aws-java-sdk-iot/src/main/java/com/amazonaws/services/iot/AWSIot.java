 * <p>
 * AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between
 * Internet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or
 * smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data
 * endpoint to communicate with, configure rules for data processing and
 * integration with other services, organize resources associated with each
 * thing (Thing Registry), configure logging, and create and manage policies and
 * credentials to authenticate things.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about how AWS IoT works, see the <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/aws-iot-how-it-works.html"
