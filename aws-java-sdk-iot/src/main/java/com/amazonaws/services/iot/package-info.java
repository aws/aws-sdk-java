/**
 * <fullname>AWS IoT</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected devices (such as sensors, actuators,
 * embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint to
 * communicate with, configure rules for data processing and integration with other services, organize resources
 * associated with each device (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage policies and credentials to
 * authenticate devices.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about how AWS IoT works, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/aws-iot-how-it-works.html">Developer Guide</a>.
