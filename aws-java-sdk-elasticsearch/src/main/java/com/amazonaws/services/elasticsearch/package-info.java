/**
 * <fullname>Amazon Elasticsearch Configuration Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Use the Amazon Elasticsearch Configuration API to create, configure, and manage Elasticsearch domains.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For sample code that uses the Configuration API, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-configuration-samples.html">Amazon
 * Elasticsearch Service Developer Guide</a>. The guide also contains <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-request-signing.html">sample code
 * for sending signed HTTP requests to the Elasticsearch APIs</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The endpoint for configuration service requests is region-specific: es.<i>region</i>.amazonaws.com. For example,
 * es.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. For a current list of supported regions and endpoints, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticsearch-service-regions" target="_blank">Regions
