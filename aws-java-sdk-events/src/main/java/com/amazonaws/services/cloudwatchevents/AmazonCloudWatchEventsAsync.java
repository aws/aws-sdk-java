/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon CloudWatch Events asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future
 * object representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.cloudwatchevents.AbstractAmazonCloudWatchEventsAsync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. When your resources change
 * state, they automatically send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the
 * stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule.
 * For example, you can configure rules to:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance
 * enters the running state.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential
 * security or availability risks.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For more information about the features of Amazon CloudWatch Events, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events">Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</a>.

     * <p>
     * A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a
     * matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can
     * have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as
     * on a schedule.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you
     * organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user
     * permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use the <code>PutRule</code> operation and
     * assign tags, you must have both the <code>events:PutRule</code> and <code>events:TagResource</code> permissions.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the <code>PutRule</code> operation are ignored. To
     * update the tags of an existing rule, use <a>TagResource</a> and <a>UntagResource</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, CloudWatch
     * Events uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating
     * event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In CloudWatch Events, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired
     * repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to
     * change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires
     * the rule again, creating an infinite loop.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your
     * rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change.
     * </p>
     * <p>
