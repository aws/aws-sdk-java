/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run
 * Kubernetes on AWS without needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an
 * open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins
 * and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications
 * running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This
 * means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification
 * required.
 * </p>
