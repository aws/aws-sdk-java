/**
 * <fullname>AWS CloudFormation</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS CloudFormation allows you to create and manage AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can
 * use AWS CloudFormation to leverage AWS products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store,
 * Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly
 * scalable, cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines
 * a collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member
 * resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about AWS CloudFormation, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS
 * CloudFormation Product Page</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need additional technical information about a specific
 * AWS product, you can find the product's technical documentation at <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/">docs.aws.amazon.com</a>.
