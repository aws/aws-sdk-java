/**
 * <fullname>AWS Key Management Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the AWS
 * KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/"> <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java,
 * Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and
 * other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors,
 * and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install
 * them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher
 * suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral
 * Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Signing Requests</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you <i>do
 * not</i> use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the
 * access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user, or you can use the AWS Security Token Service to generate
 * temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All AWS KMS operations require <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Logging API Requests</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and
 * delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can
 * determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about
 * CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.

 * <b>Commonly Used APIs</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Of the APIs discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely
 * perform actions other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.
