/**
 * <fullname>AWS CodePipeline</fullname>
 * <p>
 * <b>Overview</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the actions and data types for AWS
 * CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline is only configurable through the API. For additional information,
 * see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS CodePipeline User
 * Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, and transitions, as described below.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <i>Pipelines</i> are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named, and consists of stages,
 * actions, and transitions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can work with pipelines by calling:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>CreatePipeline</a>, which creates a uniquely-named pipeline.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>DeletePipeline</a>, which deletes the specified pipeline.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns information about the pipeline structure and pipeline metadata, including the
 * pipeline Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetPipelineExecution</a>, which returns information about a specific execution of a pipeline.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which returns information about the current state of the stages and actions of a pipeline.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>ListPipelines</a>, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines associated with your account.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>ListPipelineExecutions</a>, which gets a summary of the most recent executions for a pipeline.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>StartPipelineExecution</a>, which runs the the most recent revision of an artifact through the pipeline.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>UpdatePipeline</a>, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to the structure of the pipeline.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Pipelines include <i>stages</i>. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete before the next stage
 * begins. A stage will result in success or failure. If a stage fails, then the pipeline stops at that stage and will
 * remain stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes action to
 * re-run the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which displays the status
 * of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns the entire
 * structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the structure of stages
 * and actions, also refer to the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html">AWS CodePipeline Pipeline
 * Structure Reference</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Pipeline stages include <i>actions</i>, which are categorized into categories such as source or build actions
 * performed within a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline
 * from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but you do define
 * and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as <a>CreatePipeline</a> and
 * <a>GetPipelineState</a>. Valid action categories are:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Source
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Build
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Test
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Deploy
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Approval
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Invoke
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Pipelines also include <i>transitions</i>, which allow the transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a
 * pipeline after the actions in one stage complete.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can work with transitions by calling:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>DisableStageTransition</a>, which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>EnableStageTransition</a>, which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the
 * expected sequence varies from the standard API user. In order to integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers will
 * need to work with the following items:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Jobs</b>, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source action might import a revision of an
 * artifact from a source.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can work with jobs by calling:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>AcknowledgeJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job,
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetJobDetails</a>, which returns the details of a job,
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>PollForJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs to act upon,
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>PutJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure, and
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>PutJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job success.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Third party jobs</b>, which are instances of an action created by a partner action and integrated into AWS
 * CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by members of the AWS Partner Network.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can work with third party jobs by calling:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job,
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetThirdPartyJobDetails</a>, which requests the details of a job for a partner action,
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>PollForThirdPartyJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs to act upon,
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure, and
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job success.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
