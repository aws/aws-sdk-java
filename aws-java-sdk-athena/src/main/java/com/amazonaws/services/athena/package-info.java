/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that lets you use standard SQL to analyze data directly in Amazon S3.
 * You can point Athena at your data in Amazon S3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds. Athena is
 * serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage. You pay only for the queries you run. Athena scales
 * automatically—executing queries in parallel—so results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries. For
 * more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html">What is Amazon Athena</a> in
 * the <i>Amazon Athena User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you connect to Athena using the JDBC driver, use version 1.1.0 of the driver or later with the Amazon Athena API.
 * Earlier version drivers do not support the API. For more information and to download the driver, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html">Accessing Amazon Athena with JDBC</a>.
 * </p>

 * For code samples using the AWS SDK for Java, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/code-samples.html">Examples and Code Samples</a> in the <i>Amazon
 * Athena User Guide</i>.
