 * AWS Cloud Map lets you configure public DNS, private DNS, or HTTP namespaces that your microservice applications run
 * in. When an instance of the service becomes available, you can call the AWS Cloud Map API to register the instance
 * with AWS Cloud Map. For public or private DNS namespaces, AWS Cloud Map automatically creates DNS records and an
 * optional health check. Clients that submit public or private DNS queries, or HTTP requests, for the service receive
 * an answer that contains up to eight healthy records.
