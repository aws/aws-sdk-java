    "documentation" : "<fullname>AWS Key Management Service</fullname> <p>AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/\"> <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS.</p> <p>Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p> <p> <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you <i>do not</i> use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests.</p> <p>All AWS KMS operations require <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/\">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Additional Resources</b> </p> <p>For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html\">AWS Security Credentials</a> - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used for accessing AWS.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html\">Temporary Security Credentials</a> - This section of the <i>IAM User Guide</i> describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a> - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Commonly Used API Operations</b> </p> <p>Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>Encrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>Decrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GenerateDataKey</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

However, you can use the <a>DeleteAlias</a> operation to delete the alias and then create a new alias with the desired name.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can use an alias name or alias ARN to identify a CMK in AWS KMS cryptographic operations and in the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. However, you cannot use alias names or alias ARNs in API operations that manage CMKs, such as <a>DisableKey</a> or <a>GetKeyPolicy</a>.

AWS KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. However, if you prefer, you can specify the <code>KeyId</code> to ensure that a particular CMK is used to decrypt the ciphertext. If you specify a different CMK than the one used to encrypt the ciphertext, the <code>Decrypt</code> operation fails.</p> <p>Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the Decrypt operation on a particular CMK, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user Decrypt permission on all CMKs. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by CMKs in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account CMK permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for <code>Decrypt</code> permissions, limit the user to particular CMKs or particular trusted accounts.</p> <p>The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

The CMK must have a <code>KeyUsage</code> value of <code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.</code> To find the <code>KeyUsage</code> of a CMK, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. </p> <p>If you use a symmetric CMK, you can use an encryption context to add additional security to your encryption operation. If you specify an <code>EncryptionContext</code> when encrypting data, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the data. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an <code>InvalidCiphertextException</code>. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context\">Encryption Context</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>If you specify an asymmetric CMK, you must also specify the encryption algorithm. The algorithm must be compatible with the CMK type.</p> <important> <p>When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.</p> <p>You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.</p> </important> <p>The maximum size of the data that you can encrypt varies with the type of CMK and the encryption algorithm that you choose.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Symmetric CMKs</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT</code>: 4096 bytes</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <code>RSA_2048</code> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1</code>: 214 bytes</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256</code>: 190 bytes</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <code>RSA_3072</code> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1</code>: 342 bytes</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256</code>: 318 bytes</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <code>RSA_4096</code> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1</code>: 470 bytes</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256</code>: 446 bytes</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

To request an asymmetric data key pair, use the <a>GenerateDataKeyPair</a> or <a>GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext</a> operations.</p> <p> <code>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</code> is identical to the <a>GenerateDataKey</a> operation except that returns only the encrypted copy of the data key. This operation is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some point, but not immediately. When you need to encrypt the data, you call the <a>Decrypt</a> operation on the encrypted copy of the key. </p> <p>It's also useful in distributed systems with different levels of trust. For example, you might store encrypted data in containers. One component of your system creates new containers and stores an encrypted data key with each container. Then, a different component puts the data into the containers. That component first decrypts the data key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt data, puts the encrypted data into the container, and then destroys the plaintext data key. In this system, the component that creates the containers never sees the plaintext data key.</p> <p> <code>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</code> returns a unique data key for each request. The bytes in the keys are not related to the caller or CMK that is used to encrypt the private key.</p> <p>To generate a data key, you must specify the symmetric customer master key (CMK) that is used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric CMK to generate a data key. To get the type of your CMK, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation.</p> <p>If the operation succeeds, you will find the encrypted copy of the data key in the <code>CiphertextBlob</code> field.</p> <p>You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. If you specify an <code>EncryptionContext</code>, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException.

For details, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/download-public-key.html#download-public-key-considerations\">Special Considerations for Downloading Public Keys</a>.</p> <p>To help you use the public key safely outside of AWS KMS, <code>GetPublicKey</code> returns important information about the public key in the response, including:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-CustomerMasterKeySpec\">CustomerMasterKeySpec</a>: The type of key material in the public key, such as <code>RSA_4096</code> or <code>ECC_NIST_P521</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-KeyUsage\">KeyUsage</a>: Whether the key is used for encryption or signing.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-EncryptionAlgorithms\">EncryptionAlgorithms</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-SigningAlgorithms\">SigningAlgorithms</a>: A list of the encryption algorithms or the signing algorithms for the key.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Although AWS KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations, it is crucial that you use this information to prevent the public key from being used improperly. For example, you can prevent a public signing key from being used encrypt data, or prevent a public key from being used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported by AWS KMS. You can also avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm in a verification operation.</p> <p>The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an asymmetric CMK outside of AWS KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/\">AWS Encryption SDK</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html\">Amazon S3 client-side encryption</a>.

This ensures that the ciphertext is decrypted only by using a particular CMK. If the CMK that you specify cannot decrypt the ciphertext, the <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation fails.</p> </li> <li> <p>To reencrypt the data, you must specify the <i>destination CMK</i>, that is, the CMK that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric CMK. If the destination CMK is an asymmetric CMK, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the CMK.</p> <important> <p>When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.</p> <p>You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.</p> </important> </li> </ul> <p>Unlike other AWS KMS API operations, <code>ReEncrypt</code> callers must have two permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>kms:EncryptFrom</code> permission on the source CMK</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>kms:EncryptTo</code> permission on the destination CMK</p> </li> </ul> <p>To permit reencryption from</p> <p> or to a CMK, include the <code>\"kms:ReEncrypt*\"</code> permission in your <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html\">key policy</a>.

Before you can connect your custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, you must change the <code>kmsuser</code> account password and update the key store password value for the custom key store.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>NETWORK_ERRORS</code> - Network errors are preventing AWS KMS from connecting to the custom key store.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SUBNET_NOT_FOUND</code> - A subnet in the AWS CloudHSM cluster configuration was deleted. If AWS KMS cannot find all of the subnets that were configured for the cluster when the custom key store was created, attempts to connect fail. To fix this error, create a cluster from a backup and associate it with your custom key store. This process includes selecting a VPC and subnets.
