In production, this feature is particularly useful to redirect your player base seamlessly to the latest game server update. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. Use a simple alias to point to an active fleet. Use a terminal alias to display a message to incoming traffic instead of routing players to an active fleet. This option is useful when a game server is no longer supported but you want to provide better messaging than a standard 404 error.</p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description.

      "documentation" : "<p>Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see <a>CreateGameSessionQueue</a>). When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out. A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request.</p> <p>When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order. Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players. </p> <p>To place a new game session request, specify the queue name and a set of game session properties and settings. Also provide a unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You'll use this ID to track the status of the placement request. Optionally, provide a set of IDs and player data for each player you want to join to the new game session. To optimize game play for the players, also provide latency data for all players. If successful, a new game session placement is created. To track the status of a placement request, call <a>DescribeGameSessionPlacement</a> and check the request's status. If the status is Fulfilled, a new game session has been created and a game session ARN and region are referenced. If the placement request times out, you have the option of resubmitting the request or retrying it with a different queue. </p>",

  "documentation" : "<fullname>Amazon GameLift Service</fullname> <p> Amazon GameLift is a managed service for developers who need a scalable, dedicated server solution for their multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift provides tools to acquire computing resources and deploy game servers, scale game server capacity to meet player demand, and track in-depth metrics on player usage and server performance.</p> <p>The Amazon GameLift service API includes important features:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Find game sessions and match players to games – Retrieve information on available game sessions; create new game sessions; send player requests to join a game session.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure and manage game server resources – Manage builds, fleets, queues, and aliases; set autoscaling policies; retrieve logs and metrics.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This reference guide describes the low-level service API for Amazon GameLift. We recommend using either the Amazon Web Services software development kit (<a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk\">AWS SDK</a>), available in multiple languages, or the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS command-line interface</a> (CLI) tool. Both of these align with the low-level service API. In addition, you can use the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/home\">AWS Management Console</a> for Amazon GameLift for many administrative actions.</p> <p>You can use some API actions with Amazon GameLift Local, a testing tool that lets you test your game integration locally before deploying on Amazon GameLift. You can call these APIs from the AWS CLI or programmatically; API calls to Amazon GameLift Local servers perform exactly as they do when calling Amazon GameLift web servers. For more information on using Amazon GameLift Local, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/integration-testing-local.html\">Testing an Integration</a>.</p> <p> <b>MORE RESOURCES</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/\">Amazon GameLift Developer Guide</a> – Learn more about Amazon GameLift features and how to use them. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://gamedev.amazon.com/forums/tutorials\">Lumberyard and Amazon GameLift Tutorials</a> – Get started fast with walkthroughs and sample projects.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gamedev/\">GameDev Blog</a> – Stay up to date with new features and techniques.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://gamedev.amazon.com/forums/spaces/123/gamelift-discussion.html\">GameDev Forums</a> – Connect with the GameDev community.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/doc-history.html\">Amazon GameLift Document History</a> – See changes to the Amazon GameLift service, SDKs, and documentation, as well as links to release notes. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>API SUMMARY</b> </p> <p>This list offers a functional overview of the Amazon GameLift service API.</p> <p> <b>Finding Games and Joining Players</b> </p> <p>You can enable players to connect to game servers on Amazon GameLift from a game client or through a game service (such as a matchmaking service).
