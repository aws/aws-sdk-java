 * <p>
 * AWS Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as collecting
 * system inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs),
 * and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely
 * manage the configuration of your managed instances. A <i>managed instance</i> is any Amazon EC2 instance or
 * on-premises machine in your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems Manager.
