 * <p>
 * <b>Overview</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation for one of the programming or command
 * line interfaces you can use to manage Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which
 * means that some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine
 * when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a change is applied
 * immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift
 * cluster management interfaces, go to <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html">Using the Amazon Redshift Management
 * Interfaces</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity,
 * monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus
 * on using your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html">Amazon Redshift Getting Started
 * Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you are a database developer, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html">Amazon
 * Redshift Database Developer Guide</a> explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that make up
 * your data warehouse.
