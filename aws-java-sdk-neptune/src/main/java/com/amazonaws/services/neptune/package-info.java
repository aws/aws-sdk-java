 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run
 * applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built,
 * high-performance graph database engine optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with
 * milliseconds latency. Amazon Neptune supports popular graph models Property Graph and W3C's RDF, and their respective
 * query languages Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL, allowing you to easily build queries that efficiently navigate
 * highly connected datasets. Neptune powers graph use cases such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge
 * graphs, drug discovery, and network security.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface reference for Amazon Neptune contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you
 * can use to manage Amazon Neptune. Note that Amazon Neptune is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might
 * require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this
 * reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot,
 * or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics
 * from the user guide.
