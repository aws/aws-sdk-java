/**
 * Interface for accessing OpsWorksCM.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.opsworkscm.AbstractAWSOpsWorksCM} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS OpsWorks CM</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS OpsWorks for configuration management (CM) is a service that runs and manages configuration management servers.
 * You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet
 * Enterprise servers, and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Glossary of terms</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Server</b>: A configuration management server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server
 * runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services, such as Amazon
 * Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the
 * configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop
 * servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Engine</b>: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you want to use. Valid values in this release
 * include <code>Chef</code> and <code>Puppet</code>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Backup</b>: This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM
 * creates an S3 bucket for backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of a server's
 * configuration-related attributes at the time the backup starts.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Events</b>: Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks
 * run, when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a server, the server's
 * events are also deleted.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Account attributes</b>: Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These
 * attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Endpoints</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Your
 * servers can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * opsworks-cm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * opsworks-cm.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * opsworks-cm.us-west-1.amazonaws.com
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * opsworks-cm.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * opsworks-cm.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * opsworks-cm.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * opsworks-cm.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Throttling limits</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All API operations allow for five requests per second with a burst of 10 requests per second.
 * </p>
