/**
 * <p>
 * Using AWS Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for
 * developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. AWS Batch utilizes the advantages
 * of this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required
 * infrastructure, while also adopting a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these advantages, AWS Batch
 * can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted, thus effectively helping to eliminate
 * capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more quickly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As a fully managed service, AWS Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch automatically
 * provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific
 * workloads. With AWS Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can
 * focus your time and energy on analyzing results and solving your specific problems.
