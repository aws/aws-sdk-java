/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers who just need virtual private servers.
 * Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly - a virtual machine, a managed database,
 * SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP - for a low, predictable price. You manage those
 * Lightsail servers through the Lightsail console or by using the API or command-line interface (CLI).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the <a
 * href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/all">Lightsail Dev Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use the Lightsail API or the CLI, you will need to use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to generate access
 * keys. For details about how to set this up, see the <a href=
 * "http://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/how-to/article/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli"
 * >Lightsail Dev Guide</a>.
