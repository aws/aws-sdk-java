/**
 * Interface for accessing Route53Resolver.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.route53resolver.AbstractAmazonRoute53Resolver} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS resolution within the VPC from Route 53 Resolver.
 * By default, Resolver answers DNS queries for VPC domain names such as domain names for EC2 instances or ELB load
 * balancers. Resolver performs recursive lookups against public name servers for all other domain names.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and your network over a Direct Connect or VPN connection:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Forward DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53 Resolver</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers
 * to easily resolve domain names for AWS resources such as EC2 instances or records in a Route 53 private hosted zone.
 * For more information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-network-to-vpc"
 * >How DNS Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer
 * Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Conditionally forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2 instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on
 * your network. To forward selected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names for the DNS
 * queries that you want to forward (such as example.com), and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network
 * that you want to forward the queries to. If a query matches multiple rules (example.com, acme.example.com), Resolver
 * chooses the rule with the most specific match (acme.example.com) and forwards the query to the IP addresses that you
 * specified in that rule. For more information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-vpc-to-network"
 * >How Route 53 Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer
 * Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Like Amazon VPC, Resolver is regional. In each region where you have VPCs, you can choose whether to forward queries
 * from your VPCs to your network (outbound queries), from your network to your VPCs (inbound queries), or both.
 * </p>
