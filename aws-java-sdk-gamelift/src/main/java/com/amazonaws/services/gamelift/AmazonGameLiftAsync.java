     * players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status
     * <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the
     * ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an
     * error.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have
     * registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session
     * is created for the match.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed
     * match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more
     * players rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For
     * tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to <code>CANCELLED</code>, and
     * processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed.

     * <p>
     * Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon EC2 instances
     * for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your AWS

     * GameLift console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * An Amazon EC2 launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon EC2 instances with your game server build. For
     * more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">
     * Launching an Instance from a Launch Template</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * An IAM role that extends limited access to your AWS account to allow GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with
     * the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html">Create IAM roles
     * for cross-service interaction</a> in the <i>GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon EC2 launch template, and
     * provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and minimum
     * limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on
     * a GameLift FleetIQ metric.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the
     * Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group,
     * including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling
     * group. Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift FleetIQ as part
     * of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.

     * <p>
     * Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon EC2 instances
     * for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your AWS
     * account, and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of your game server groups in the
     * GameLift console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * An Amazon EC2 launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon EC2 instances with your game server build. For
     * more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">
     * Launching an Instance from a Launch Template</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * An IAM role that extends limited access to your AWS account to allow GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with
     * the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html">Create IAM roles
     * for cross-service interaction</a> in the <i>GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon EC2 launch template, and
     * provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and minimum
     * limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on
     * a GameLift FleetIQ metric.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the
     * Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group,
     * including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling
     * group. Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift FleetIQ as part
     * of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.

    /**
     * <p>
     * Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. Whether your are using FlexMatch with GameLift
     * hosting or as a standalone matchmaking service, the matchmaking configuration sets out rules for matching players
     * and forming teams. If you're also using GameLift hosting, it defines how to start game sessions for each match.
     * Your matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to handle different game scenarios. All matchmaking
     * requests (<a>StartMatchmaking</a> or <a>StartMatchBackfill</a>) identify the matchmaking configuration to use and
     * provide player attributes consistent with that configuration.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following: configuration name and FlexMatch mode
     * (with or without GameLift hosting); a rule set that specifies how to evaluate players and find acceptable
     * matches; whether player acceptance is required; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When
     * using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting, you also need to identify the game session queue to use when starting a
     * game session for the match.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In addition, you must set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to receive matchmaking notifications,
     * and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration. An alternative method, continuously polling ticket
     * status with <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a>, is only suitable for games in development with low matchmaking usage.

    /**
     * <p>
     * Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's
     * hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet
     * metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of
     * scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet
     * scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained
     * control over auto-scaling.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based
     * policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple
     * auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a> with the fleet
     * action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a> with the same fleet action. To
     * stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with
     * <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html">Set Up Fleet Automatic
     * Scaling</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>Target-based policy</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a
     * fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer;
     * it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based
     * policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to
     * maintain that target.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous
     * game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls
     * below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order
     * to return to the 10% buffer.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased".
     * Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with
     * your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned.
     * The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling
     * actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>Rule-based policy</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to
     * initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each
     * policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of
     * action.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, a policy may make the following statement:
     * "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%."
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A policy's rule statement has the following structure:
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code> for
     * <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by
     * <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for
     * <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type
     * to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy
     * name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the
     * fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions
     * are restarted.

     * To register a game server, identify the game server group and instance where the game server is running, and
     * provide a unique identifier for the game server. You can also include connection and game server data. When a
     * game client or service requests a game server by calling <a>ClaimGameServer</a>, this information is returned in
     * the response.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Once a game server is successfully registered, it is put in status <code>AVAILABLE</code>. A request to register
     * a game server may fail if the instance it is running on is in the process of shutting down as part of instance
     * balancing or scale-down activity.

     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>gameSessionId</b> -- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a <code>GameSessionId</code>
     * or <code>GameSessionArn</code> value.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>gameSessionName</b> -- Name assigned to a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session
     * with <a>CreateGameSession</a> or updating with <a>UpdateGameSession</a>. Game session names do not need to be
     * unique to a game session.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>gameSessionProperties</b> -- Custom data defined in a game session's <code>GameProperty</code> parameter.
     * <code>GameProperty</code> values are stored as key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the key and a
     * string to search the data values for. For example, to search for game sessions with custom data containing the
     * key:value pair "gameMode:brawl", specify the following: <code>gameSessionProperties.gameMode = "brawl"</code>.
     * All custom data values are searched as strings.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>maximumSessions</b> -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session. This value is set when
     * requesting a new game session with <a>CreateGameSession</a> or updating with <a>UpdateGameSession</a>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>creationTimeMillis</b> -- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as
     * milliseconds.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>playerSessionCount</b> -- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly
     * as players join the session or drop out.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>hasAvailablePlayerSessions</b> -- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum
     * number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize
     * search performance and return only sessions that players can join.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * Returned values for <code>playerSessionCount</code> and <code>hasAvailablePlayerSessions</code> change quickly as
     * players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to refresh
     * search results often, and handle sessions that fill up before a player can join.
     * </p>
     * </note>
     * <p>
     * To search or sort, specify either a fleet ID or an alias ID, and provide a search filter expression, a sort
     * expression, or both. If successful, a collection of <a>GameSession</a> objects matching the request is returned.
     * Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can search for game sessions one fleet at a time only. To find game sessions across multiple fleets, you must
     * search each fleet separately and combine the results. This search feature finds only game sessions that are in
     * <code>ACTIVE</code> status. To locate games in statuses other than active, use <a>DescribeGameSessionDetails</a>.

     * Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session. This operation can be used to add players to

     * By backfilling with the same matchmaker used to create the original match, you ensure that new players meet the
     * match criteria and maintain a consistent experience throughout the game session. You can backfill a match anytime
     * after a game session has been created.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To request a match backfill, specify a unique ticket ID, the existing game session's ARN, a matchmaking
     * configuration, and a set of data that describes all current players in the game session. If successful, a match
     * backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. The ticket is placed in the matchmaker's

     * </p>

     * The process of finding backfill matches is essentially identical to the initial matchmaking process. The
