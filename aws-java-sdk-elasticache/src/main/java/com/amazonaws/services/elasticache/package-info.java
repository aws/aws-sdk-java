/**
 * <fullname>Amazon ElastiCache</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a distributed cache in the
 * cloud.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance, in-memory cache with less of the
 * administrative burden involved in launching and managing a distributed cache. The service makes setup, scaling, and
 * cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache deployment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced visibility into the key performance
 * statistics associated with their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.
 * </p>
