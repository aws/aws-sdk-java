/**
 * <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname>
 * <p>
 * A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across targets, such as your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase
 * the availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and
 * ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy targets. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic
 * by specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from
 * clients to the load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port number for connections from the
 * load balancer to the targets, and with health check settings to be used when checking the health status of the
 * targets.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load
 * Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An Application Load Balancer makes routing and load balancing decisions at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS). A
 * Network Load Balancer makes routing and load balancing decisions at the transport layer (TCP/TLS). Both Application
 * Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers can route requests to one or more ports on each EC2 instance or container
 * instance in your virtual private cloud (VPC).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A Classic Load Balancer makes routing and load balancing decisions either at the transport layer (TCP/SSL) or the
 * application layer (HTTP/HTTPS), and supports either EC2-Classic or a VPC. For more information, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic Load Balancing User Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This reference covers the 2015-12-01 API, which supports Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. The
 * 2012-06-01 API supports Classic Load Balancers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To get started, complete the following tasks:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Create a load balancer using <a>CreateLoadBalancer</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Create a target group using <a>CreateTargetGroup</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Register targets for the target group using <a>RegisterTargets</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Create one or more listeners for your load balancer using <a>CreateListener</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * To delete a load balancer and its related resources, complete the following tasks:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Delete the load balancer using <a>DeleteLoadBalancer</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Delete the target group using <a>DeleteTargetGroup</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they complete at most one time. If you repeat
 * an operation, it succeeds.
 * </p>
