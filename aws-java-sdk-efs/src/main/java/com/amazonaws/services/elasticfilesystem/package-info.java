 * <p>
 * Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances in
 * the AWS Cloud. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and
 * remove files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they need it. For more information, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/api-reference.html">User Guide</a>.
