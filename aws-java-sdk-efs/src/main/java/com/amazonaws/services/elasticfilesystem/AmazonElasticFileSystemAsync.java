     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If the request provides an <code>IpAddress</code>, Amazon EFS assigns that IP address to the network interface.

     * <code>CreateNetworkInterface</code> call does when a request does not specify a primary private IP address).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If the request provides <code>SecurityGroups</code>, this network interface is associated with those security

     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>

     * fails, the entire <code>CreateMountTarget</code> operation fails.
