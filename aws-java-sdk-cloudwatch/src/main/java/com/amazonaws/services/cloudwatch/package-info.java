/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time.
 * You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources
 * and applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you
 * define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use
 * this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this
 * data to stop under-used instances to save money.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With
 * CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational
 * health.
