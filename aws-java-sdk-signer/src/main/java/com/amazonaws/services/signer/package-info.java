/**
 * <p>
 * With code signing for IoT, you can sign code that you create for any IoT device that is supported by Amazon Web
 * Services (AWS). Code signing is available through <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/">Amazon FreeRTOS</a> and <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/">AWS IoT Device Management</a>, and integrated with <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/">AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</a>. In order to sign code, you
 * import a third-party code signing certificate with ACM that is used to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT
 * Device Management. For general information about using code signing, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html">Code Signing for IoT Developer Guide</a>.
