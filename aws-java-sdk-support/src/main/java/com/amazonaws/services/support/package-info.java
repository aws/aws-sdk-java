/**
 * <fullname>AWS Support</fullname>
 * <p>
 * The <i>AWS Support API Reference</i> is intended for programmers who need detailed information about the AWS Support
 * operations and data types. You can use the API to manage your support cases programmatically. The AWS Support API
 * uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the
 * <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For information about changing your support plan,
 * see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Support service also exposes a set of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/">AWS
 * Trusted Advisor</a> features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify
 * checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels - The <a>DescribeServices</a> and
 * <a>DescribeSeverityLevels</a> operations return AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem
 * severity levels. You use these values when you call the <a>CreateCase</a> operation.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Case creation, case details, and case resolution - The <a>CreateCase</a>, <a>DescribeCases</a>,
 * <a>DescribeAttachment</a>, and <a>ResolveCase</a> operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about
 * cases, and resolve cases.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Case communication - The <a>DescribeCommunications</a>, <a>AddCommunicationToCase</a>, and <a>AddAttachmentsToSet</a>
 * operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Support service for Trusted Advisor:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks</a> returns the list of checks that run against your AWS resources.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Using the <code>checkId</code> for a specific check returned by <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks</a>, you can call
 * <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult</a> to obtain the results for the check that you specified.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries</a> returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck</a> requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses</a> reports the refresh status of one or more checks.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing
 * Process</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html">About the AWS Support API</a> in the
 * <i>AWS Support User Guide</i> for information about how to use this service to create and manage your support cases,
 * and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources.
