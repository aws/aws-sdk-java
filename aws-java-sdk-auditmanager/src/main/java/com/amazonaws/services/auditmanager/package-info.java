/**
 * <p>
 * Welcome to the AWS Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the
 * AWS Audit Manager API operations, data types, and errors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Audit Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collection so that you can continuously audit your
 * AWS usage, and assess the effectiveness of your controls to better manage risk and simplify compliance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Audit Manager provides pre-built frameworks that structure and automate assessments for a given compliance
 * standard. Frameworks include a pre-built collection of controls with descriptions and testing procedures, which are
 * grouped according to the requirements of the specified compliance standard or regulation. You can also customize
 * frameworks and controls to support internal audits with unique requirements.
