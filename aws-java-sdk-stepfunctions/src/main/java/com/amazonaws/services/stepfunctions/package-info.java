/**
 * <fullname>AWS Step Functions</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices
 * using visual workflows.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components, each of which performs a discrete
 * function, or <i>task</i>, allowing you to scale and change applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console
 * that helps visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step Functions automatically triggers
 * and tracks each step, and retries steps when there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the
 * right order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly diagnose and debug any issues.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Step Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your application is available at any scale.
 * You can run tasks on AWS, your own servers, or any system that has access to AWS. You can access and use Step
 * Functions using the console, the AWS SDKs, or an HTTP API. For more information about Step Functions, see the <i> <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html">AWS Step Functions Developer Guide</a> </i>.
